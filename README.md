### Introduction

This is my fisrt application in frappe framework. I don't give ANY WARRANTY, but it works!!!.

I made this because it will be necessary in my country to operate, this and other things i intent to do for this framework.

I also made this to learn the frappe framework and don't double check neither the code and neither i was concerned with code presentation. So maybe the code is not too well structured.
Maybe another time with more time!!!

This app check if the VAT / NIF is correct. This app use module vatnumber to check the VAT for the particular country and optionaly will be fully validated against EU's VIES service.

This is un adaptation from this work: [https://github.com/odoo/odoo/tree/master/addons/base_vat](github)
